He currently writes code for ``Neuroimagers`` who study the ``brain`` and all the ``weird things`` that happen in/to it. The brain is a seriously complicated system and no one really knows what's going on, but it's very pretty.

Once upon a time, he was an aerospace engineer. There were rockets involved. Also pictures of the ``ocean``. Maybe in the future there will be rockets to **Mars** again and then he will probably become a ``Martian``.

The Andromeda Galaxy will collide with us in approximately ~4 billion years. He hopes to be there to watch.
